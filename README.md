# School lessons

*This is my side-projecct, based on my school-work and other research.
Through 10-11 grade I've been learning breath-taking stuff within the help of my brilliant teachers of math and IT [@Harrix](https://github.com/Harrix).
This repositoriy - my interpretation of all info I've gained trough y school-years, which i want to collect and share with future students of it class*

## How to use?

For now on the best to start with would be my conspects at [conspects](https://github.com/chellick/School_lessons/tree/main/info/conspects). Which contains info for:

* Linear algebra
* Math analysis
* Useful IT themes
* TODO: add themes
